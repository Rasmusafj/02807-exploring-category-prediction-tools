Moving over to Go has made it painfully apparent how spoiled Python devs are to have the Requests library.
I've been developing Python web apps and scripts to help automate my business for years and I make some heavy use of Requests for HTTP interaction in a few projects. Recently I started toying around with Go to branch out into more easily redistributable software, WebAssembly, and mobile app development. I started by trying to port over some existing Python scripts.

What quickly became apparent is exactly how much time and code Requests has saved me over the years. The session management is so stupidly plug-and-play simple. That's not to say the Go http package is bad, Requests is just really, really convenient, powerful, and well-organized.

So cheers to the maintainers of Requests. It's by far the thing I miss most while I'm learning Go.
